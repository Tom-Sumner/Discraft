Discraft lets you play a 2D version of Minecraft inside of discord!
Discord uses [**Nextcord**](https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord) to create a user-freindly game with buttons to move your character and nicely formatted messages. Discraft also uses slash commands, so no remebering the bot prefix!
Discraft uses custom world generation so you will never play the same map!

## Example
##### Just type /play and click enter!![Just type /play and click enter!](https://i.imgur.com/uYEcrxI.png)

##### The world generation will take a few seconds and then play!
